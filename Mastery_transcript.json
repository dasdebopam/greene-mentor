The rift with his father was permanent and extremely painful, but sensing that\n\n[02:52:53] his time was short and that he had almost too much to express, he threw himself into his music with an intensity\n\n[02:53:00] that was even greater than what he had displayed in childhood, as if all of his ideas had been pinned\n\n[02:53:05] up for too long. He exploded in a creative outburst unprecedented in the history of music. The apprenticeship of\n\n[02:53:11] the past 20 years had prepared him well for this moment.

He was 25 years old and losing valuable time; his father and the Archbishop were actively holding him\n\n[02:52:18] back. He loved his father and depended on his family for emotional support, but he could tolerate his circumstances no\n\n[02:52:25] longer. When it was time to return to Salzburg, he did the unthinkable: he\n\n[02:52:30] refused to leave. He asked to be dismissed from his position.

of these opinions do not come from our own\n\n[03:09:51] deep reflection but are instead based on what other people think furthermore once we hold these ideas to admit they are\n\n[03:09:58] wrong is to wound our ego and vanity truly creative people in all Fields can\n\n[03:10:04] temporarily suspend their ego and simply experience what they are seeing without the need to assert a judgment for as\n\n[03:10:10] long as possible they are more than ready to find their most cherished opinions contradicted by reality this\n\n[03:10:16] ability to endure and even Embrace Mysteries and

apprenticeship qualitatively\n\n[04:15:35] different from those of an ordinary person was the intensity of his attention he did not simply read books\n\n[04:15:40] he took them apart rigorously analyzed them and learned valuable lessons to apply to his own life he did not merely\n\n[04:15:48] socialize he strained to understand people at their core and to uncover their secret motivations he did not\n\n[04:15:54] merely translate but strove to inhabit the mind of Ruskin himself in the end he\n\n[04:16:00] even used the death of his mother to intensify his development with her gone he would have to ride himself out of his\n\n[04:16:06] depression and find a way to recreate the feelings between them in the book he was to write as he later described it\n\n[04:16:12] all of these experiences were like seeds and once he had started his novel he was like a gardener tending and cultivating\n\n[04:16:18] the plants that had taken Roots so many years before like proust you must must also maintain a sense of Destiny and\n\n[04:16:25] feel continuously connected to it you are unique and there is a purpose to your uniqueness you must see every\n\n[04:16:32] setback failure or hardship as a trial along the way as seeds that are being planted for further cultivation no\n\n[04:16:39] moment is wasted if you pay attention and learn the lessons contained in every experience
