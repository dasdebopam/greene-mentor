Michael turned the peasant Basilius into a sophisticated and educated courtier\n\n[00:04:21] who later on became greedy for more wealth and power and had his former benefactor and best friend Michael\n\n[00:04:27] murdered. Michael, true to his future on the sense of gratitude he fought, Basilius must feed for him he had\n\n[00:04:33] created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up close, a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything and\n\n[00:04:40] got it, who felt encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did what many people do in such a situation:\n\n[00:04:45] they forget the favors they have received and imagine they have earned their success by their own merits.\n\n[00:04:51] Another example is this Song Dynasty, who ruled China for 300 years, but how I\n\n[00:04:57] destroyed my enemies when I make them my friends. Abraham Lincoln, for several centuries after the fall of the Han\n\n[00:05:04] Dynasty, 822 Chinese history followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups:\n\n[00:05:10] one after the other, army men with plots to kill a weak Emperor then would replace him on the dragon throne with a\n\n[00:05:16] strong General. The general would start a new Dynasty and crown himself Emperor to ensure his own survival. He would kill\n\n[00:05:22] off his fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would resume: new generals would arise and assassinate\n\n[00:05:28] him or his sons. In their turn to be emperor of China was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemies. It was\n\n[00:05:35] the least powerful, least secure position in the realm. In 89 out of 59 generals,\n\n[00:05:40] Sauk Huang Jin—I hope I'm saying this right—became Emperor's Song. Emperor's Song knew that his friends in the army\n\n[00:05:47] would chew him up like meat, and if he somehow survived, his friends in the government would have him for supper.\n\n[00:05:53] Emperor's Song persuaded his generals to retire to a life of nobility and give up\n\n[00:05:59] their dreams of grabbing his throne.

People held him in awe. He decided to run for the Senate and he spoke his mind hardly able to control his\n\n[00:16:27] arrogance and boastfulness. He slandered and insulted people. The more speeches he made the less people respected him. He\n\n[00:16:34] suffered the people's wrath and was eventually banished from the city. Number six: people will not deceive you as they\n\n[00:16:40] will never know your position. Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His infamous \"I shall see\" was one of\n\n[00:16:47] several extremely short phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests. Louis was not always this way. As a young\n\n[00:16:54] man he was known for talking at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later tested serenity was self-imposed,\n\n[00:17:00] an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off balance. No one knew exactly where he stood or could predict\n\n[00:17:06] his reactions. No one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to hear because no one knew\n\n[00:17:12] what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and on to the silent Louis, they revealed more and more about themselves.\n\n[00:17:18] Information he would later use against them to great effect. In the end, Louis' silence kept those around him terrified\n\n[00:17:24] and under his tongue. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint Simon wrote, no one knew as well as he how to\n\n[00:17:30] sell his words, his smile, and even his glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences and his\n\n[00:17:37] Majesty was enhanced by the scarceness of his words. Saying less than necessary is not for things and statesmen only; in\n\n[00:17:44] most areas of life, the less you say the more profound and mysterious you appear. By saying less than necessary you create\n\n[00:17:50] the appearance of meaning and power. Also, the less you say the less risk you run\n\n[00:17:55] of saying something foolish.

{"title": "48laws — Page 80", "content": "[02:37:50] Near the end of the reign of Louis 15 all our friends seemed desperate for change when the king's grandson and\n\n[02:37:56] chosen successor for the future Louis XVI married the 15 year old daughter of the Empress of Austria. The French caught a\n\n[02:38:02] glimpse of the future that seemed hopeful: the young bride Marie Antoinette. But as soon as Marie Antoinette became\n\n[02:38:09] Queen, she abandoned herself to the pleasures she loved most, ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and\n\n[02:38:15] jewelry in the realm, sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her sculpted quaffios rising as much as three feet\n\n[02:38:21] above her head and throwing a constant succession of masked balls and feasts.\n\n[02:38:26] All of these whims she paid for on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills. She had been\n\n[02:38:34] running up her huge expenditures. The country was headed for ruin, but her subjects could rot in hell for all she\n\n[02:38:40] cared. In 1789, an unprecedented event took\n\n[02:38:46] place: the beginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry, let the people have their little Rebellion.\n\n[02:38:51] She seemed to think it would soon quiet down and she would be able to resume her life of pleasure. That year the people\n\n[02:38:58] marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit the palace and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph\n\n[02:39:04] for the rebels, but it offered the queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she had opened and established contact with\n\n[02:39:10] the people. The queen, however, had not learned her lesson. Not once would she leave the palace during her stay in\n\n[02:39:16] Paris. In October of 1793, when the revolution officially declared the end of the\n\n[02:39:22] monarchy, she was found guilty and finally knelt at the guillotine on repentance and defiant to the bitter end.\n\n[02:39:29] Here are five of the most disastrous attitudes in the realm of power. Types like Marie Antoinette live in their own\n\n[02:39:36] bubble. They seem to feel they are born kings and queens and that attention is owed them. They do not consider anyone\n\n[02:39:42] else's nature but bulldoze over people with their self-righteous arrogance, pampered and indulged as children so as\n\n[02:39:49] adults they still believe that everything must come to them, convinced of their own charm.

At the core, it suggests that humans aren't always as rational as they believe themselves to be.

It's an age-old sentiment where the grass always seems greener on the other side. At its core, this law speaks to our tendencies to compare ourselves to others and to constantly seek more. This might manifest in envying a colleague's promotion, longing for a\n\n00:10:23 - 00:11:28\n\nfriend's luxurious lifestyle, or wishing for attributes or talents that others possess. These feelings can be rooted in various factors: social environments, personal insecurities, and cultural influences can all feed into this longing for more or different. For instance, in a world dominated by social media where snapshots of people's best moments are on constant display, it's easy to feel left behind or lacking in some way. We see curated highlights and can't help but compare them to our\n\n00:10:56 - 00:12:16\n\nbehind-the-scenes realities. However, this constant yearning can be a double-edged sword. On one side, it can be a motivator — aspiring for more can push us to strive, innovate, and grow. It's the force that drives progress and ambition. Yet on the flip side, if left unchecked, it can also lead to dissatisfaction, unrest, and a feeling of never having enough. Being aware of this innate tendency is key. By recognizing when we're falling into the trap of endless wanting, we can pause and reflect on the root of these desires. Is it\n\n00:11:35 - 00:12:53\n\ngenuine aspiration or just a fleeting envy? Do we truly want what we're longing for, or are we just caught in the cycle of comparison? By asking these questions, we can differentiate between healthy ambition and mere covetousness. This helps in grounding ourselves, appreciating what we have, and pursuing what truly matters to us.\n\nIdea 6: the law of shortsightedness\nThe law of shortsightedness delves into our natural tendency to focus on the immediate, often at the expense of the long-term. It's a reflection of how our brains are wired\n\n00:12:14 - 00:13:22\n\nto prioritize the present moment, especially when faced with perceived threats or immediate rewards.

Every day people are influenced by their surroundings, media, peers, and countless subtle cues. The power of influence lies in directing these often unnoticed forces to achieve a desired outcome. Manipulation, on the other hand, carries a more negative connotation; it involves using cunning or deceptive tactics to get someone to act or think in a particular way. Often the\n\n00:59:09 - 01:00:15\n\nmanipulator has a hidden agenda and their goal is personal gain even if it's at the expense of the other person. Both influence and manipulation leverage a deep understanding of human nature, but they are applied with different intentions. An influential person might use their understanding of someone's desires and fears to motivate them, helping them achieve their goals. A manipulator, conversely, might exploit those same desires and fears to control or deceive. It's important to be aware of\n\n00:59:42 - 01:00:58\n\nthese dynamics not only to navigate situations where one might be influenced or manipulated but also to understand the ethical implications of wielding such power.

At the heart of power dynamics is the concept of control. Those with power, whether it's due to their position, resources, or personal charisma, have the capacity to influence outcomes and shape situations to their liking. They set the tone for interactions and often determine the rules of the game. Yet power isn't static; it shifts based on circumstances, actions, and perceptions. A\n\n01:00:56 - 01:02:07\n\nperson might possess power in one context and be powerless in another. Moreover, the perception of power can sometimes be as influential as actual power.

Empathy offers a window into other people's worlds. When we empathize, we see situations from their perspective, feel their joys and sorrows, and can better anticipate their needs and reactions. This deep connection allows for richer and more meaningful interactions. But empathy is not just about understanding emotions; it also involves deciphering nonverbal cues, understanding motivations, and recognizing unspoken desires or fears.\n\n01:02:43 - 01:03:54\n\nIt's like tuning into a frequency that reveals the layers beneath the surface of human interactions.

Moreover, empathy isn't just beneficial in personal\n\n01:03:17 - 01:04:34\n\nrelationships, in leadership, negotiations, or any sphere where understanding others is crucial, and empathy becomes an indispensable asset.

These are not objective truths; rather, they are concepts and norms created and agreed upon by societies over time. Think of them as invisible scripts that influence our behavior, values, and relationships.

This shared belief then dictates numerous aspects of our daily lives.\n\nSimilarly, notions of beauty, success, and morality vary across cultures and eras. These constructs influence how we see ourselves, judge others, and interact with the world around us. They can dictate fashion trends, professional hierarchies, and even who we consider to be family.\n\nHowever, just because these beliefs are constructed doesn't mean they're easily changeable. Many of these ideas are deeply ingrained, having been passed down through generations and are reinforced by media, education, and other societal institutions.

As with all others, we are merely born with the capability to do it—the skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe said there exists a form of power and intelligence that represents the high point of human potential. It is the source of the greatest achievements and discoveries in history. It is an intelligence that is not taught in our schools nor analyzed by professors.\n\nAlmost all of us at some point have had glimpses of it in our own experience. It often comes to us in a period of tension—facing a deadline, the urgent need to solve a problem, a crisis of sorts—or it can come as the result of constant work on a project. In any event, pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused. Our minds become completely absorbed in the task before us. This intense concentration sparks all kinds of ideas. They come to us as we fall asleep, out of nowhere, as if springing from our unconscious.\n\nAt these times, other people seem less resistant to our influence. Perhaps we are more attentive to them or we appear to have a special power that inspires their respect. We might normally experience life in a passive mode, constantly reacting to this or that instant, but for these days or weeks, we feel like we can determine events and make things happen.\n\nWe could express this power in the following way: most of the time we live in an interior world of dreams, desires, and obsessive thoughts, but in this period of exceptional creativity, we are impelled by the need to get something done that has a practical effect. We force ourselves to step outside our inner chamber of habitual thoughts and connect to the world. At these moments, suddenly exposed to new details and ideas, we become more inspired and creative.\n\nOnce the deadline has passed or the crisis is over, this feeling of power and heightened creativity generally fades.", "source": "Mastery_transcript", "meta": {"book": "mastery", "page": 1}}
